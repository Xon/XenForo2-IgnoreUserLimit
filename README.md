# XenForo2-IgnoreUserLimit

Enforces per-user group limits on for how long an ignored user list is permitted to be.

Disable User Ignore feature permits the ignore feature to be completely disabled for a usergroup.

When a user is made staff, everyone who is ignoring that user has the ignore feature disabled.

New Permission:
- User Ignore Limit (default for registered users: -1)
- Disable User Ignore feature
